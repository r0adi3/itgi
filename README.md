interactive Teaching Goal Inventory or iTGI

The iTGI is an javascript-based program that helps teachers make use of the book, Classroom Assessment Techniques (CATs)-A Handbook for College Teachers. Users prioritize their learning goals and the program helps them quickly identify which of the CATs in the book are most appropriate for use with those goals.
